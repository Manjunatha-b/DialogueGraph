## Introduction
Created a Windows program with drag drop structure to create a graph data structure for dialogue intensive games.

Project was originally intended for something else but got sidetracked : /

## So far 

1. Can create a dialogue with right click on canvas
1. Can create links between two dialogues
1. Can delete the link with a right click
1. Can add more options for each dialogue that will serve as path to another dialogue
1. basic dialogue is created from unitDialogue object.
1. the unitDialogue object has a list of paths.
1. each path has an option name and pointer to the next dialogue that the option will correspond to.

## Todo ( Main )

1. Add panning with middle mouse button.
1. Write a CSV generator for the graph.
1. Scrap my own code for another project with similar needs.
